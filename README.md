PHP Calculus I Functions
============

The goal of this library is to show how to solve basic Calculus functions in PHP. The general focus is on derivatives. Using this library, it possible to enter a basic equation such as 2x^2+3x^10+4x+19 and achieve the answer. 
You can recursively run the getDerivative function on the terms to get the second and third derivatives. Chain rule and trig have not been implemented yet.

Requirements
============

This library should run on as low as `PHP >= 4.3.x` 

Installation
============

To install, just upload/download the files. You can run example.php in a web browser or via CLI

Usage
